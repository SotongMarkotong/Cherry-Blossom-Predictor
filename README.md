# Cherry-Blossom-Predictor

The main function of this regression model is to predict the peak bloom day of cherry blossoms in Kyoto, Japan based on the features:
- latitude
- longitude
- altitude
- year

The model is built by using the Ridge Regression model with hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation(5-fold) done to find the best hyperparameter value alpha and to ensure no bias was involved in the model. <br />

The dataset that was used was obtained from the CherryBlossomCompeition, source: https://github.com/GMU-CherryBlossomCompetition/peak-bloom-prediction/tree/main/data
